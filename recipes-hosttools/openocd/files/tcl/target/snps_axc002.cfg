# AXC002 CPU card for the AXS101.
#
# Contains ARC HS34 and ARC HS 36.
#

# _CHIPNAME really should be same for all cores and be something like AXC001,
# however at the moment ARC OpenOCD will use chip name to decide whether it is
# ARC 600, ARC 700 or ARC EM. Therefore we need to set it each time for each
# core. This crutch can be removed after the way how OpenOCD distinguishes
# different ARCs will be fixed and CHIPNAME will be just a chip name.

# AXC002 contains 2 cores: ARC HS34 and ARC HS36. Three JTAG combinations are
# possible, depending on configuration of TSEL jumpers:
# 1. All cores are in chain;
# 2. Only ARC HS34 is in the chain;
# 3. Only ARC HS36 is in the chain.
# Default is "all in". Caller may use variables HAS_[HS34|HS36] to override.
